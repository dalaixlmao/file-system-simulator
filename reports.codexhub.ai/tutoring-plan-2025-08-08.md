# C++ File System Simulator Tutoring Plan

## Overview
This tutoring plan focuses on enhancing your understanding of the C++ File System Simulator project. After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several areas where we can improve code quality and deepen your understanding of C++ best practices.

## Project Assessment
The File System Simulator is a C++ application that simulates a file system with basic operations like creating files and folders, navigating directories, and managing content. The project uses:
- OOP principles with inheritance and encapsulation
- STL containers (maps, vectors, stacks)
- Command-line interface
- Singleton pattern for the Storage class

## Learning Goals
1. Understanding and implementing proper memory management in C++
2. Applying design patterns effectively
3. Implementing exception handling for robust code
4. Writing clean, maintainable code with modern C++ practices
5. Improving code structure and architecture

## Tutoring Plan

### 1. Memory Management in C++
**Identified Issues:**
- Potential memory leaks in service classes (FileSystemService, FileService, FolderService)
- Missing destructors in classes with dynamic allocation
- Improper resource management

**Learning Resources:**
- Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern
- Smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr)
- Proper destructor implementation

### 2. Design Patterns Improvement
**Identified Issues:**
- Singleton pattern implementation could be improved
- Service layer architecture needs refinement
- Component relationships need better definition

**Learning Resources:**
- Modern C++ Singleton implementation
- Service-oriented architecture in C++
- Dependency Injection principles

### 3. Exception Handling
**Identified Issues:**
- Lack of exception handling for error cases
- Using cout for error reporting instead of proper error handling
- No validation for potential error conditions

**Learning Resources:**
- C++ exception hierarchy
- Best practices for error handling
- Creating custom exceptions

### 4. Modern C++ Features
**Identified Issues:**
- Limited use of modern C++ features (C++11 and beyond)
- Manual string handling that could be simplified
- Not leveraging STL algorithms effectively

**Learning Resources:**
- C++11/14/17 features that improve code quality
- STL algorithms for efficient operations
- Lambda expressions and functional programming in C++

### 5. Testing and Validation
**Identified Issues:**
- No testing framework in place
- Limited input validation
- No separation between UI and business logic (making testing difficult)

**Learning Resources:**
- Introduction to unit testing in C++
- Test-driven development principles
- Input validation techniques

## Implementation Plan
1. Create example files demonstrating proper memory management
2. Refactor the Singleton pattern implementation with modern C++ features
3. Add exception handling to critical operations
4. Introduce smart pointers to prevent memory leaks
5. Create examples of unit tests for key components
6. Demonstrate code organization improvements

## Outcome
By the end of this tutoring plan, you'll gain:
1. Deeper understanding of C++ memory management
2. Knowledge of implementing design patterns correctly
3. Skills to write robust, exception-safe code
4. Familiarity with modern C++ features and idioms
5. Ability to write testable, maintainable code

## Topics and Timeline
1. **Memory Management Best Practices** - Critical path
2. **Design Pattern Improvements** - Critical path
3. **Exception Handling Implementation** - High priority
4. **Modern C++ Features** - Medium priority
5. **Testing Strategies** - Medium priority

Each topic will include:
- Theoretical explanations
- Code examples in context of the file system simulator
- Practice exercises
- Suggested improvements to your codebase
