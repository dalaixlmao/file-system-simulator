## Critical Findings

### 1. Memory Leaks - No Memory Deallocation

**Location:** Multiple files, primarily in Storage.cpp (lines 22, 29, 34, 68, 87) and FileSystemService.cpp (lines 41-42)

**Category:** Resource Leak

**Risk Analysis:**  
The application allocates memory using `new` but never deallocates it with `delete`. This pattern occurs throughout the codebase. For instance, the Storage class creates a new FileSystem instance, the FileSystemService creates service instances, and objects are allocated dynamically when creating files and folders. Since there are no destructors that call `delete` on these pointers, all dynamically allocated memory will be leaked when the program terminates, or worse, could exhaust available memory during extended use.

**Examples:**
```cpp
// src/storage/Storage.cpp:22
return instance = new Storage();

// src/storage/Storage.cpp:29
fileSystem = new FileSystem();

// src/storage/Storage.cpp:68
File *f = new File(newFileId, name, folderId);

// src/services/FileSystemService.cpp:41-42
folderService = new FolderService();
fileService = new FileService();
```

**Preventative Refactoring:**
1. Implement proper destructors for all classes that manage resources:
```cpp
// Add to Storage.h
~Storage() {
    delete fileSystem;
    for(auto& pair : files) {
        delete pair.second;
    }
    for(auto& pair : folders) {
        delete pair.second;
    }
}

// Add to FileSystemService.h
~FileSystemService() {
    delete folderService;
    delete fileService;
}
```

2. Consider using smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) to manage memory automatically:
```cpp
// Instead of raw pointers
std::unique_ptr<FileSystem> fileSystem;
std::map<string, std::unique_ptr<File>> files;
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. Create a memory leak detector test that runs the application under valgrind or similar tools.
2. Create a test that creates and deletes many files and folders in a loop to ensure memory usage remains stable.

**Suggested Logging:**
Add logging for object creation and destruction to track resource lifecycle.

### 2. Null Pointer Dereference in Storage::getCurrentFolder()

**Location:** src/models/FileSystem.cpp (line 22-26)

**Category:** Potential Null Reference

**Risk Analysis:**  
The FileSystem::getCurrentFolder() method returns the top element of the path stack without checking if the stack is empty first. If the stack is empty, accessing `path.top()` will result in undefined behavior and likely crash the application. This function is called extensively throughout the codebase, making this a critical issue.

**Code:**
```cpp
string FileSystem::getCurrentFolder()
{
    if (!path.empty())
        return path.top();
}
```

Note that this function has a return type of string but doesn't return anything if the stack is empty, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, the calling code in Storage and other services doesn't check for empty returns.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
```cpp
string FileSystem::getCurrentFolder()
{
    if (!path.empty()) {
        return path.top();
    }
    return ""; // Or throw an exception, or return a special value like "ROOT"
}
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. Test behavior when the path stack is empty.
2. Test behavior after removing all folders from the stack.

**Suggested Logging:**
Add logging when attempting to access the current folder with an empty path stack.

### 3. Inconsistent File Path Parsing in File.cpp

**Location:** src/models/File.cpp (lines 7-21)

**Category:** Logic Error

**Risk Analysis:**  
The File constructor attempts to split a filename into name and extension by searching for the first dot (.) character. However, it assumes that all filenames have extensions, and more critically, it doesn't properly handle the case where a dot isn't found, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior.

**Code:**
```cpp
File::File(string id, string fileName, string folderId) : id(id), folderId(folderId)
{
    string n;
    int ind;
    for (int i = 0; i < fileName.size(); i++)
        if (fileName[i] == '.')
        {
            ind = i;
            break;
        }
    n = fileName.substr(0, ind);
    string ex = fileName.substr(ind + 1, n.size() - ind - 1);
    name = n;
    extension = ex;
}
```

Problems:
1. If no dot is found, `ind` remains uninitialized and using it will lead to undefined behavior
2. The calculation for extension length is incorrect: `n.size() - ind - 1` doesn't make sense as `n` is already truncated to `ind` characters
3. No validation for empty filename or extension

**Preventative Refactoring:**
```cpp
File::File(string id, string fileName, string folderId) : id(id), folderId(folderId)
{
    size_t dotPos = fileName.find_last_of('.');
    if (dotPos != string::npos) {
        name = fileName.substr(0, dotPos);
        extension = fileName.substr(dotPos + 1);
    } else {
        // Handle files without extension
        name = fileName;
        extension = "";
    }
}
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. Test with filenames without extensions
2. Test with filenames containing multiple dots
3. Test with empty filenames
4. Test with very long filenames

**Suggested Logging:**
Add validation logging when parsing unusual filenames.

## Major Findings

### 4. Missing Error Handling and Exception Safety

**Location:** Throughout codebase

**Category:** Error Handling

**Risk Analysis:**  
The codebase doesn't implement any exception handling or proper error reporting mechanisms. Operations that could fail (like accessing non-existent map elements) are performed without checks. The application outputs error messages to console but doesn't have a robust error handling strategy, making it fragile and prone to crashes.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
1. Implement a proper error handling strategy using exceptions or error codes:
```cpp
// Example using exceptions
File* Storage::getFile(string id) {
    auto it = files.find(id);
    if (it == files.end()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("File not found: " + id);
    }
    return it->second;
}
```

2. Add try-catch blocks in the main command processing loop:
```cpp
try {
    // Process command
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    cout << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
}
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. Test behavior when accessing non-existent files or folders
2. Test behavior with invalid input parameters
3. Test with edge cases like maximum path depth or very long filenames

**Suggested Logging:**
Implement structured logging for errors with details about the operation and context.

### 5. Race Condition in Singleton Implementation

**Location:** src/storage/Storage.cpp (lines 18-25)

**Category:** Race Condition Risk

**Risk Analysis:**  
The Storage class uses a singleton pattern but its implementation isn't thread-safe. If the application were to be extended to support multithreading, multiple threads could simultaneously determine that `instance` is null and create multiple instances, leading to data corruption and unpredictable behavior.

**Code:**
```cpp
Storage *Storage::getInstance()
{
    if (instance == nullptr)
    {
        return instance = new Storage();
    }
    return instance;
}
```

**Preventative Refactoring:**
Use a thread-safe singleton implementation:
```cpp
Storage* Storage::getInstance()
{
    static Storage instance;
    return &instance;
}
```

Alternatively, if dynamic allocation is necessary:
```cpp
Storage* Storage::getInstance()
{
    static std::once_flag flag;
    std::call_once(flag, []() {
        instance = new Storage();
    });
    return instance;
}
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. If extending to multithreaded environment, test concurrent access to the singleton
2. Test the initialization sequence to ensure proper setup

**Suggested Logging:**
Add initialization logging for the singleton instance.

### 6. Resource Management Issues in removeFile/removeFolder

**Location:** src/storage/Storage.cpp (lines 180-244)

**Category:** Resource Management

**Risk Analysis:**  
The removeFile and removeFolder methods set pointers to nullptr but don't properly delete the objects, leading to memory leaks. Additionally, the removeDFS method has similar issues and doesn't properly handle potential null pointers.

**Code:**
```cpp
// In removeDFS
files[i.first] = nullptr;
// ...
folders[node] = nullptr;
```

This doesn't free the memory associated with these objects.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
```cpp
// In removeDFS
delete files[i.first];
files.erase(i.first);
// ...
delete folders[node];
folders.erase(node);
```

**Recommended Test Cases:**
1. Test memory usage before and after removing files and folders
2. Test behavior after removing and recreating files and folders with the same names

**Suggested Logging:**
Log resource deletion events with identifiers.

## Minor Issues

### 7. Inconsistent Return Value in FileService::showFilePath

**Location:** src/services/FileService.cpp (line 20)

**Category:** Potential Bug

**Risk Analysis:**  
The showFilePath method is declared to return void but contains a return statement that calls another method. This is likely a copy-paste error, and while many compilers may not flag this, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Code:**
```cpp
void FileService::showFilePath(string fileId) { return Storage::getInstance()->showFilePath(fileId); }
```

**Preventative Refactoring:**
```cpp
void FileService::showFilePath(string fileId) { Storage::getInstance()->showFilePath(fileId); }
```

### 8. Missing Input Validation for File and Folder Names

**Location:** Multiple places, e.g., src/storage/Storage.cpp

**Category:** Input Validation

**Risk Analysis:**  
The code doesn't validate file or folder names for prohibited characters or length limits, potentially allowing creation of files with invalid names that could cause issues in the UI or if the system were to be extended to interact with real file systems.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
Add validation functions:
```cpp
bool isValidFileName(const string& name) {
    // Check for length limits
    if (name.empty() || name.size() > 255) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check for invalid characters
    const string invalidChars = "/\\:*?\"<>|";
    if (name.find_first_of(invalidChars) != string::npos) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### 9. Missing Access Modifiers in Class Declarations

**Location:** Multiple header files

**Category:** Code Structure

**Risk Analysis:**  
All class declarations properly define private data members, but some classes might benefit from protected members to enable inheritance. The current structure doesn't pose an immediate risk but could limit future extensibility.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
Review class hierarchies and add protected sections where appropriate for potential extension points.

### 10. Hard-coded string literals for special folder IDs

**Location:** src/storage/Storage.cpp (lines 30-36)

**Category:** Code Maintainability

**Risk Analysis:**  
Special folder IDs like "F0", "F1", "FX" are hard-coded throughout the code without clear documentation of their significance, making the code harder to maintain and understand.

**Preventative Refactoring:**
Define constants for special folder IDs:
```cpp
// In Storage.h
static const string ROOT_FOLDER_ID = "F0";
static const string BASE_FOLDER_ID = "F1";
static const string PARENT_OF_ROOT_ID = "FX";
```

## Recommendations

1. **Implement proper memory management**: Add destructors and use smart pointers where appropriate.
2. **Add comprehensive error handling**: Use exceptions or error codes for graceful error handling.
3. **Fix null pointer dereference issues**: Always check for null before dereferencing.
4. **Make the singleton implementation thread-safe**: Use std::call_once or a similar mechanism.
5. **Improve input validation**: Add checks for all user inputs.
6. **Enhance file and folder path handling**: Support proper handling of various path formats.
7. **Add unit and integration tests**: Focus on edge cases and error conditions.
8. **Implement consistent logging**: Add structured logging throughout the application.
9. **Define constants for magic values**: Replace hardcoded strings and numbers with named constants.
10. **Add documentation**: Improve code comments explaining the purpose and logic of complex operations.

Following these recommendations will significantly improve the code quality, stability, and maintainability of the File System Simulator project.
