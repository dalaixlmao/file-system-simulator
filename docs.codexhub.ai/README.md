   - Understanding RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
   - Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)
   - Preventing memory leaks
   - Custom memory management techniques

2. [Design Patterns](02-design-patterns.md)
   - Modern Singleton implementation
   - Composite pattern for file systems
   - Factory Method pattern
   - Command pattern for operations

3. [Exception Handling](03-exception-handling.md)
   - Creating a custom exception hierarchy
   - Exception safety guarantees
   - Best practices for error handling
   - When to use exceptions vs. error codes

4. [Modern C++ Features](04-modern-cpp-features.md)
   - Smart pointers and move semantics
   - Range-based for loops and structured bindings
   - Lambda expressions
   - std::optional and std::variant

5. [Testing Strategies](05-testing-strategies.md)
   - Unit testing with Google Test
   - Integration and system testing
   - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Mock objects and test fixtures

## Example Code

Each topic includes working example code in the `examples` directory:

- [Memory Management Example](examples/memory-management-example.cpp)
- [Design Patterns Example](examples/design-patterns-example.cpp)
- [Exception Handling Example](examples/exception-handling-example.cpp)
- [Modern C++ Features Example](examples/modern-cpp-example.cpp)
- [Testing Example](examples/testing-example.cpp)

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with the tutoring plan**: Review the overall plan in [reports.codexhub.ai/tutoring-plan-2025-08-08.md](../reports.codexhub.ai/tutoring-plan-2025-08-08.md)

2. **Learn sequentially**: Begin with Memory Management as it's fundamental, then progress through the other topics

3. **Practice with examples**: Study the example code and try to implement the concepts in your project

4. **Complete the exercises**: Each guide includes practice exercises to reinforce your learning

5. **Apply to your codebase**: Each topic suggests specific files from your project that would benefit from applying these concepts
